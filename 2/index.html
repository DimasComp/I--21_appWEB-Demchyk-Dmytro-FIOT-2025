        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I was born on August 29, 1958, in Gary, Indiana. As the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, I began performing with my brothers in the Jackson 5 at a young age. My solo career skyrocketed in the 1980s with albums like *Thriller* and *Bad*.
        </p>
        <p>
          My music combines pop, funk, soul, and rock influences, and I‚Äôm recognized for my vocal style, fashion, and iconic dance moves ‚Äî especially the moonwalk. My work has broken records, changed pop culture, and inspired generations of artists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond music, I dedicated much of my life to humanitarian efforts and children's charities, believing in the power of love and unity.
